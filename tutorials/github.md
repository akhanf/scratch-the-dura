# Intro to Github
[(Official Tutorial)](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/)

Though mastering Github can take years, we want to shed light on some of the basics and provide a
"best practices" for using Github for your projects. For those of you successfully using the GUI
application for Github, you may not realize it but you are doing each of the steps below. We will
explain each of the necessary steps for getting a local copy of a repository, adding new files or
updates, and pushing them back to the repository in the cloud.

The unavoidable commands when using Github are: `create`, `clone`, `pull`, `status`, `add`, `commit`,
and `push`. In short, these can be summarized as follows:

- Starting a project requires you to **`create`** a repository
- When you **`clone`** a repo you make a local copy of a repository
- **`Pulling`** updates your local copy of the repository
- Requesting a **`status`** update reminds you what changes you have made locally
- You can **`add`** code/resources to the repository
- When your changes are ready to save you **`commit`** them
- When your changes are ready to share you **`push`** them

Using these commands (both via commandline and GUI) we will create our own repositories, clone them,
add a text file and some documentation about it, and commit+push them back to the cloud. This should
give us enough background to start using Github for the following sections, as well.
